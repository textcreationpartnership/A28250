            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Full documentation of the original data capture process is available from the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.
   All versions of the texts are now archived and freely available for download. See <ref target="https://textcreationpartnership.org/faq/#faq05">the TCP Download FAQ</ref>
   for detailed information. The TEI P5 versions are also freely available from the <ref target="https://github.com/textcreationpartnership">TCP Github repository</ref>.</p>

            <p>I Answer, By <hi>my People,</hi> or the <hi>People of the Lord,</hi> We do un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstand all such in every Nation, Kindred, and People who fear the Lord, be they known, or distinguished by whatsoever Name,
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:100370:3"/> or Appellation; They, or such in every Nation, Kindred, and People; howsoever called, or distinguished, who fear God, and work Righteousness are accepted of him. As <hi>Peter</hi> said in the case of <hi>Cornelius</hi> who was converted to the Faith, who was be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore a Gentile, and without the Law; and so the <hi>Jewes</hi> had no Conversation with such till after Jesus was offered up; who broke down the midle wall of Partition that was between, have<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing abolished in his flesh the emnity, even the Law of Comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dements contained in Ordinances, for to make in Himself one New-man, so making peace. <hi>Eph.</hi> 2. 14. <hi>Of a truth</hi> (saith <hi>Peter) I perceive that God is no Respecter of Persons; but in every Nation be that feareth God and worketh Righteousness is accepted of Him, Acts</hi> 10. 34, 35.</p>
            <p>So that when we say, <hi>my People,</hi> or <hi>the People of the Lord,</hi> We restrain it not to any sort, or particular Company, or society of men, but to such as fear the Lord, as aforesaid. And for such the Law was not made, but for the lawless and the disobedient; for the ungodly, and for Sinners; for unholy, and profane; for Murderers of Fathers, and murderers of Mothers; for Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>slayers; for Whoremongers; for them that defile themselves with Mankind; for Men stealers, for lyars; for perjur'd persons; and if there be any thing that is contrary to sound Doctrine, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the Glorious Gospel of the Blessed God, which was committed to my trust. Saith the Apostle. 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 1. 9, 10, 11.</p>
            <p>And to these the Magistrate of God is a terror; to evil works; to that which is evil, for he beareth not the Sword in vain. For he is the Minister of God, a Revenger, to execute Wrath on him that doth evil. As <hi>Paul</hi> said to the <hi>Romans;</hi> who were then un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the Power of the Heathen Emperour; and to them he also said, <hi>Viz.</hi> To the believing <hi>Romans,</hi> as to such things ye must needs be subject, not only for Wrath, but also for Conscience sake Because, there is no Power but of God, and the Powers that be (saith he) are ordained of God. For (saith he) Rulers are not a terror to good works, but to evil. Whosoever therefore, res<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="3 letters">
                  <desc>•••</desc>
               </gap> the Power, resisteth the Ordinance of God; and they that resi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap> receive to themselves Damnation. For, he is a Minister of God to thee for good: Wilt thou not then be afraid of the Power? Do that which is good; and thou shalt have Praise of the same;
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:100370:3"/> but if thou do that which is evil be afraid, for he beareth not the Sword in Vain, (as aforesaid.) Therefore, let every Soul be sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject to the Higher Powers, for there is no Power but of God. The Powers that be are ordained of God, <hi>Rom.</hi> 13. 1, 2, 3, 4, 5. And so thou hast an Answer to thy First Question.</p>
            <p>To the second <hi>(sc.)</hi> What mean you by this Phrase, <hi>Thus saith the Lord?</hi> Do you only intend thereby that you are per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swaded in your Opinions that the Will of the Lord is thus? Or, do you intend as the Holy Prophets of Old, that these Words that you utter are not your Own Words, but that you are inspi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red of God, and speak them as moved of the Lord? If so, then we pray you tell us by what Rules shall We measure what you say, whether it be tru<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>, or not, whether you be mist<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ken or not, or whether what you utter as from the Lord be not indeed a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lusion. For We hear others telling us that the Lord saith direct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly contrary to what you say the Lord saith. Now as We are bound on pain of Damnation to believe that to be true which the Lord saith; so also are we bound on pain of Damnation, not to believe a lie as the Word of the Lord.</p>
            <p>I Answer, When we say, <hi>thus saith the Lord,</hi> We intend, and <note place="margin">Concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ni<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

            <p>And if you would know by what Rule you should measure what is so said to be true, or not; mistaken or not; whether uttred as from the Lord, or a Delusion.</p>
            <p>You must know, and believe in the Principle in you which is of God, which there speaks the Word of the Lord; which what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soever the Father saith unto him there speaks, the Son of God; the measure of him in you, which convinces you of Sin; and shewes you all that ye have done, is not this the Christ? said the Woman of <hi>Samaria</hi> of him that then spake to her, whom she knew not, nor what he said, till he came to tell her all the things that ever she did; till she came to that of him in her which witnessed to what he said, which told her what she had done. Come see a man (said she) which told me all things that ever I did, is not this the Christ? <hi>Joh.</hi> 4. 29. see the History in the former part of the Chapter. For, He whom God hath sent speaketh the Words of God, <hi>Joh.</hi> 3. 34.</p>

The spirit of a man is that which gives motion to that which a man doth, or that which is the natural cause of its being, yet there is another thing that moveth the spirit of a man, and is the cause of its being, and the reason of what it doth, which may be either the spirit of God, or of this world. And these things are manifest.</p>
            <p>Besides, a man may be led by anothers understanding by an im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plicit faith, which cannot be properly called a mans own, but a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nothers, because anothers, not his own understanding is the cause thereof.</p>

            <p>Yet <hi>Paul</hi> saith another word—I know, and am perswaded by the Lord Jesus that there is nothing unclean of it self; but to him that esteemeth any thing to be unclean, to him it is unclean. He speaks of meats and drinks, keeping of a day, or not keeping of a day, and mens judging of one another in such things as are not the Kingdom of God. The Kingdom of God (saith he) is not meat and drink but righteousnesse, and peace, and joy in the Holy Ghost, for he that in these things serveth Christ, is accept<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to God, and approved of men. For meat destroy not the the work of God. All things indeed are pure, but it is evill for that man which eateth with offence, it is good neither to eat flesh nor to drink wine, nor any thing whereby thy Brother stumbleth, or is offended. (This was eating in the Idols Temple by such a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

            <p>And so when we use the word <hi>perfect;</hi> or that some among us are <hi>perfect,</hi> (which word yet I have not read of any among us that hath thus affirmed) we mean, and intend as aforesaid; and that as any come to know, and are guided by that which is <hi>perfect;</hi> and that possesseth, or leaveneth, or worketh in them; what they speak, or write from that which is <hi>perfect,</hi> is like it, as a mans <hi>word</hi> is counted the Image, or likeness of himself; therefore it is called such a mans <hi>word,</hi> because it proceedeth from him; and is the declaration of himself, and meaning, or how, or by which way, or according unto which he would be understood; which is such a mans <hi>word,</hi> to speak according to the manner of men. And if you will have something of a tryal, as a measure, to try this, to measure this; you must come to, and believe in the measure of this; and Savour, and judge with this (as hath been said) or you cannot see, try, judge, or understand what this meaneth, as aforesaid. And as any grow up in this, or are leavened by this, or possessed, or come into the Nature of this, or as the Nature of this cometh to fit them, or to turn them, or convert them into this nature; it makes them like it as aforesaid, <hi>perfect</hi> as their Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther which is in Heaven is <hi>perfect;</hi> as he <hi>is, so</hi> to be in <hi>this</hi> World.

            <p>Nor is it a certain ground on which to conclude any Principle, or practise, and so I might refuse to Reply. For we matter little what the World saith, or Men that live as they list; or are Igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant; or have emnity in them, or a ground of prejudice, or that know not things in their Principle; I say we matter little whether such say we are diabolically possessed, or distracted, and yet doe think they deale charitably with us (as you say) when they believe us to be either. Or whether they think us to be errone<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, and heretical Christians; as you also say that others goe fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and yet think themselves kind enough to Us when they af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firm us to be so. Or whether we be Christians, which you also suggest that others will not allow us to be, as being perswaded (as are thy words) that we only use the word Christ to preserve our selves from being stoned by the multitude, or at least to gain Credit among Christians; but that we in truth, by that word, intend no more, nor other thing then our own fancies, and opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, or the Results of our Reasons (as thou hast it) or mistaken Reasons, calling them (as are the words of thy Paper) sometimes the Light within us; and other times the Seed within us; and at other times Christ within us.

And as the chief Priests and Pharisees said to <hi>Pilate</hi> of him—Sir, We remember that that Deceiver said whilst he was yet alive, after three dayes I will rise again. <hi>Mat.</hi> 27: 63. We regard these things little; We have a witness in you, and the World that we are otherwise; which will have its day to speak for us.

The Father, Son, and Spirit was to be taught; God so made manifest; They were

Would you therefore have us conforme to the World, or you in things of this nature, as to which you have neither ground in the Scriptures, nor reasonable understanding?

            <p>Besides, the Baptism used by the Apostles after his Ascension, I mean the Baptism of <hi>Water</hi> had not a general Command, if any it all, but was used as Circumcision was used; and other things that were of Institution before all was finished, whilst the Law was in force; or the things that were <hi>Sacramental,</hi> or figurative, which (as I have hinted) was not ended in the Particulars of many when the outward dispensation had an end. Therefore they were borne with for a while till that which those things signified was come, (that is to say) till it were risen in them in that strength that they thereby were able to put it off. Therefore <hi>Peter</hi> was stiled the Apostle of the Circumcision; And to the <hi>Hebrewes</hi> was there an Epistle written; And there were of the believing <hi>Jewes,</hi> as well as the unbelieving; and these were baptized, and therby testified to him in whom they believed, and bore the Cross of it, which then was great, the name <hi>Christian</hi> being then a tearm of great Reproach, and suffering, and brought with it much afflicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; it being a Testimony unto him whom they had murdered, as a Deceiver, who was Lord, and King; In which sence also, or for which cause; they were baptized.

            <p>But if you hold not these things to be necessary, then we e<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

And we say that the Prophecy came not in old time by the will of Man, but Holy Men of God spake as they were moved by the Holy Ghost; Nor do we seem not to esteem our selves obliged (nor indeed do we otherwise esteem our selves obliged) by them; or any thing in them contained, (we mean such things as hold us obliged, for all things there you know hold not now an Obligation as to us, as the Law of <hi>Moses;</hi> and many other things too long to mention) as contained in them nor do we profess our selves not to stand in need either of Scriptures, Doctors, Priests, Teachers, or Pastors, or of the Teachings of Men, in order to the obtaining of Faith, or the learning Christia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity from such, or any other outward means; provided that such Doctors, Priests, Teachers, Pastors know, and speak from the Principle of God in them. For, these things are in our practice. For there are Ministers amongst us, Ministers of Christ, to whom is committed the Ministery of Reconciliation; and who turn, and have turned us from <hi>Darkness</hi> to the <hi>Light,</hi> and from the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome of Satan unto God. As was <hi>Paul</hi>'s Commission. <hi>Acts</hi> 26. 18. And we are the Seales of their Ministry. Nor do we all of us, or any of us so pretend to be taught of God immediatly, and par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularly, as that we reject, or stand not in need of Doctors, Priests, Pastours, Teachers, Scriptures; These things are falsly suggested against us; for we use them all; and so stand in need of them all (that is to say) the Scriptures, Doctors, Teachers, Priests, Pastours; as the Scriptures are the Inspiration of the Holy Ghost (and we judge them so to be) and as such Men speak from the Movings of the Spirit of God. And so this Charge is Answered; but this we say that there is not such a necessity of the Scriptures, Doctors, Priests, Teachers, Pastours, as that without them there
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:100370:22"/> can be no understanding of the things of God, no turning to God. This were to limit the Holy One of <hi>Israel,</hi> as if that without these things; <hi>viz.</hi> Scriptures, Doctors, &amp;c. there w<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="2 letters">

            <p>Secondly, We are so far from denying all manner of <hi>Ordinati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on</hi> of Men, that if Men appear fitted, and as having the Power with which the Apostles <hi>ordained</hi> of Old, we are subject unto <gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="2 letters">

For, to that we are subject, not to Men; yet to Men as that Power worketh in them. And so the Lord is exalted, Christ Jesus in all things who is Lord and King; and we have the spirit of Jesus, or the measure of Him in us; whereby we can try these things, and know whether they be of God, or wrought in God.</p>
            <pb n="47" facs="tcp:100370:24"/>
            <p> Thirdly, We are also so far from denying the <hi>Sacraments</hi> (as you call them) of Baptisme, and the Eucharist; that we allow them, or approve of them in any who shall use them so, and in such manner as they were appointed of God. As I have declared in my Answer to the second Charge, and is set down there at large.</p>
            <p>Lastly, The last Charge is this, to wit, It is charged against you that under colour of being free from Forms, and Bondage, you will take no Oathes, though in order to the ending of strife; or the saving of the Kings, your own; or other men's Lives; Nor bear Armes either against Domestick Rebells, or Forreign Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies, and Invaders; By which you render your selves useless to the King, and Country; and such as for whose Protection the Mag<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>strate is not obliged to take Care. And it is further charged, that under the same pretence of being free, you refuse to pay Tythes, which are justly due from you as any Monies upon any civil contract; you being bound thereto by an implicit Contract, and the same being allowed unto you by your Landlords, or those from whom you, or your Ancestors purchased your Lands, or Houses; and consequently, not of your Gift, but of the Gift of others passing only through your hands as Conduit Pipes, and therefore not detainable by you without high injustice; By which you render your selves suspected to injure common justice, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween party, and party, and to be unfit for the Societies of Men, and publique Conversation.</p>
            <p>To which I Answer.</p>
            <p>This Charge consisteth of many heads. First, It hath to doings with us as to <hi>Oaths,</hi> charging us, That under colour of being free <note place="margin">Concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Oaths or Sweat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing.</note> from formes, and bondage we will take no <hi>Othes</hi> though in order to the ending of strife, or the saving of our Kings, our Own, or other men's Lives.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Ans.</hi> We refuse not to <hi>Swear</hi> under colour, or pretence of be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing free from Forms, and bondage, nor of any thing else; but we are bound up in our own spirits, or hearts, or consciences from any thing of this Nature by the Law of Christ Jesus, who is King of Kings, and Lord of Lords, to whom all must account; from whose Judgment none can escape, whose Judgment is Eternal; who saith expresly, I say unto you, <hi>Swear not at all, Mat.</hi> 5. 34. Ye have heard (saith he) that it hath been said of old time, Thou shalt not

               </gap> I say unto you, <hi>Swear</hi> not at all. (As aforesaid) And we know that it was required of them of old time that they should <hi>Swe<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="2 letters">

               <hi>Christ</hi> the <hi>second</hi> Covenant was come, who was the <hi>end</hi> of it; so had this of <hi>swearing;</hi> and as he expresly put an end to many of those things, or gave another explication of them then the <hi>Jew<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="2 letters">

                  </gap>
               </hi> under the <hi>first</hi> Covenant understood, so did he to this; as this Chapter signifies. Ye have heard (saith he) that it was said by them of old time, Thou shalt not kill; and whosoever shall kill shall be in danger of the Judgment; but I say unto you whoso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever is angry with his Brother without a cause shall be in danger of the Judgment. <hi>vers.</hi> 22. Ye have heard (saith he again) th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="2 letters">

               </gap> it was said by them of old time, Thou shalt not commit Adulte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry; But I say unto you that whosoever looketh on a Woman to lust after her hath committed Adultery with her already in his heart. <hi>vers.</hi> 27, 28. It hath been said (saith he the Third time) whosoever shall put away his Wife, let him give her a Writing of Divorcement; But I say unto you whosoever shall put away his Wife saving for the cause of Fornication, causeth her to commit Adultery; and whosoever shall Marry her that is divorced, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mits Adultery. Again, ye have heard (saith he in this case) that it hath been said by them of old time, Thou shalt not <hi>forswear</hi> thy self, &amp;c. But I say unto you, <hi>swear</hi> not at all.</p>
            <p>Now who shall we believe, or who is it fit for us to obey, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="49" facs="tcp:100370:25"/> of the quick, and the dead; who shall come to judge the quick, and the dead, whose judgment is just, and cannot be avoided, and is Eternal, especially being convinced of this, and bound in our Consciences by that which is of him there, which Answers unto this his command, or the Law of Man, or the threatnings, or punishments of Man, who prescribes us our Country, and places Banishment upon us out of our Native Soile for so doing? What say yee? to the witness of God in you all I speak who are concerned in this Paper; or to whomsoever this Paper may come. Is it not better to suffer loss of Liberty, Country, Relations, All, to preserve Peace in our Consciences with God, by whom we expect to stand for ever, then because of Man; or for the enjoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of these things which are Temporary, and which attend us but for a moment, to suffer for ever? For we are absolutely con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinced in our Consciences by the witness of the <hi>Living</hi> God in this thing; and bound so that we cannot do otherwise then obey this Command; We cannot <hi>Swear,</hi> and upon this foot only; as hath been declared; and we have only relation to God; to this Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand of Jesus Christ within, and without, and to no other; and the searcher of the heart knows it, who will render to every one according to his deeds: And if we should be dispatcht out of the World with the most exquisite of Torments, and there should be a Law for that purpose; to which, we are not unsensible of some to whom we have done no wrong, that would put us; yet here we should be found as in the case of Banishment: And what good will it do those in Power, and others that are near the<gap reason="illegible" resp="#murp" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>, to put us to this? to suggust this, to see this done unto us; who simply for our Consciences to God in this particular, upon the ground aforesaid, do thus offer us up, and prompt those who are in power so to do? One would think that men who have Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sciences of their own, and in some things are bound up; at least do judge in their Consciences, that in some things they should not be put to it; and do not like those, or that which so puts them to it, though perhaps they have complied; as not being able to offer up their Bodies, for their Consciences, or to suffer; I say, one would think that such should not put their Brethren so to it; and take pleasure in such things; and that Humanity, or the common sence of men, and the Nature in the whi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#murp" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>h they are as
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:100370:26"/> Men, should prompt them otherwise; For no Man ever hated his own flesh; much more should the Institution of him who was more then Man, and yet Man, who came into the Nature, and took upon him the <hi>Seed</hi> of <hi>Abraham,</hi> not the nature of Angels; who was a merciful high Priest; and was tempted in all things like unto us, yet without sin, that he might sucour them that are tempted. Who saith, as having been in the feeling of the thing, in the nature, in the sence; and therefore took upon him the <hi>Seed</hi> of <hi>Abraham,</hi> to redeem Man out of the Transgression, out of the nature that is in the Fall, which is cruel, and hard hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, like to the Devil into whose nature Man that is fallen, is come, which makes Man like him; who bears no good will to Man, but would destroy him; I say, much more should the Institution of him be hearkned to; who was in the nature, and suffer'd in it, and therefore by experience knew what he said, when he said to his Disciples, Therefore <hi>all</hi> things whatsoever ye would that Men should do to you, do ye even so to them, for this is the Law, and the Prophets, <hi>Mat.</hi> 7. 12.</p>
            <p>But thou saist, How shall strife then be ended? Or it is char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged on us, That we will take <hi>no Oaths</hi> though in order to the en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding of strife, or the saving of our Kings, our Own, or other men's Lives.</p>
            <p>I Answer, If this were the thing indeed, and if the matter did only pinch here, and if occasion were not rather sought against us, and taken in this thing, then barely the prosecution <hi>of a Civil</hi> Law, or order amongst men; for which cause we seem to be impeacht, then a Law might make the taking of Testimony without an <hi>Oath,</hi> which (its not improbable) was in the first constitution of the common Law of this Nation, which also seems to hold it now, i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> that <hi>Oathes</hi> are not flat as in <hi>Scotland, by God,</hi> but meerly promis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sory, though called an Oath; but whether that be so or not, I say if barely, and only the support of Civil being among Men, or the prosecution of a Civil Law were the thing; A Law might make the taking of Testamony without an <hi>Oath,</hi> and render the Penal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of false Testamony the same as (or greater then) in the case of <hi>Perjury;</hi> and then we might be in the Capacity of preventing all those inconvenencies, which hereby, or not <hi>swearing</hi> is reckoned up to ensue upon the King, our selves, and others; and we might
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:100370:26"/> also be in a condition to answer those places of imployment a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong our Neighbours, which by reason of <hi>not swearing</hi> on the foot aforesaid, we cannot performe. For we do not take pleasure (how ever we may be supposed to the contrary) in seeing our Neighbours toiled in things of common Concernment, and we free; but the disability, or our not taking part with them is not, neither lies in us, (that is to say) that we will not; or that un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der pretence of being free from all forms, and bondage, we shift our necks, from all such common service, God is witness that it is otherwise, who will also one day plead our innocency in this thing with all (and he hath with many already) but in that which because of our not <hi>swearing</hi> puts us in that capacity. And I hope that in the judgment of all sober men that consider another man's condition by their own, that men of <hi>Conscience,</hi> who least they should offend the Lord, dare not <hi>swear;</hi> but are <hi>yea,</hi> or what they say is <hi>Truth,</hi> may be supposed more ponderously to weigh, and deliberately to consider (at least as much as those) what they witness, who (too commonly) rush into swearing without consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration, seeing also that the speaking of the truth, is the end of the Law; or that being done, the Law is answer'd. At furthest, if it should be otherwise, there is a penalty; the provision as in the case of <hi>false swearing,</hi> to give the Rectification. And when at worst, cannot be more bad, then they who heed not what they <hi>swear,</hi> or on purpose <hi>swear</hi> falsly; or are suborned so to do; as to whom the Law hath made a Provision. And those who in other cases can <hi>swear,</hi> and yet in some refuse there is a plain distinction for such; because that cannot be conscience as to <hi>swearing,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause an <hi>Oath</hi> or <hi>Swearing</hi> is forbiden by Christ; but some other thing as the matter. And such cannot be reckoned on this foot; at least, may be excluded. So the end of the Law by these things may be answer'd as to <hi>swearing</hi> and we live in peace; serving our Generation in the fear of the Lord, without being cut off, and made uncapable (by being contrarily done unto) of serving our Generation, and caused to suffer in our Estates, Callings, Liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, Relations, Country, Lives; if those who are in Power, or the Magistrate thinks fit so to do; seeing that it is not (and we have solemnly pronounc'd it again, and again,) that we will not, but because we cannot <hi>Swear;</hi> not under pretence of being from

Seeing that life is more then Meat, and the Body then Rayment, and a man's life more then the enjoyment of things. No, no, let not any deceive them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves so to think; Its otherwise with us, and let all be assured that we have lookt into these things as much as they, or any can; and we are as willing to save our selves; and to live in peace, and to enjoy our Country, and Relations, and all we have, as any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers are, or can be; and to be serviceable in our Generation; if we could, and keep that safe; which must stand by us whe<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

               </gap> these things are no more, and not suffer for ever. And so being put to the choice, here we must pitch rather to obey God the<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

            <p>By this time, I hope, that thou, and all others in whom is any sence of soberness, to whom these things shall come, and who shall weigh, and consider them, as indeed they are spoken, i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

               </gap> truth of heart by us, will acquit us of wilfulness in this matter of being so, and exposing our selves, and others unto what the charge saith of us under colour of being free from Formes, and Bondage; seeing that by being so in our own understandings (as

And if the Magistrate please to take this into Consideration, and Order accordingly, it will be no grief to him in the end; that to preserve a People from destru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, who are thus bound up in their Consciences to God, he hath made use of this expedient. Seeing that in other things where sometimes only a particular comes to be concerned, the Laws are dispens't with, and Provisions made, though the matters be not such as this, relating unto <hi>Conscience.</hi> If otherwise we are free, we shall choose to suffer. However we are clear of this charge in our hearts before God, and thus far unto men. I shall now pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed to the next particular.</p>
            <p>In the second place, The Charge hath to doe with us as to Armes; and it saith,—Not bear Armes against Domestick Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bels, <note place="margin">Concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing A<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

            <p>To which I answer, The matter of <hi>Armes</hi> thus stands with us. It is not (as hath been said) as to <hi>Oathes;</hi> for the termes of this charge bear to both <hi>Armes,</hi> and <hi>Oathes,</hi> and both together make up this summe of rendring us in the judgment of those who charge upon us, such as hereby render our selves useless to the King, and Country, and such as aforesaid) I say, it is not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause we will not, (that is to say) out of humour, or obstinacy; no nor out of disaffection) or that it is under colour of being free from Formes, and Bondage; that is to say, that we are not so in our Bottome, or Principle, and therefore we pretend to other things as an <hi>Asylum,</hi> or Covering, but because we stand charged before the Lord in our Consciences, as to this thing.

            <p>Thirdly, the Charge hath to do with us as to <hi>Tythes,</hi> and as to <note place="margin">Concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Tyths.</note> that it thus saith, <hi>viz.</hi> And it is further charged that under t<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap> same pretence of being free you refuse to pay <hi>Tythes;</hi> which a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>e as justly due from you as any Moneys upon any civil Contract; and the same being allowed to you by your Landlords; or those from whom you, and your Ancestors purchased your Lands, or Houses, and consequently not of your Gift, but of the Gift of others, passing only through your hands as Conduit Pipes; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:100370:30"/> not detainable by you without high injustice, by which you <gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ender your selves suspected to injure common justice between Party, and party; and to be unfit for the Societies of Men, and publique conversation.</p>
            <p>To this I Answer that the Charge is false upon us in this parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular, as in the former. For, under the same pretence, or under <gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ny pretence it is not that we refuse the payment of Tythes; nor doth the Argument hold in this Particular. For, we refuse not <hi>Tythes</hi> upon the account you speak of; nor upon any other respect then that they were part of the <hi>Levitical</hi> Law, which with that whole Administration is done away by the coming of <hi>Christ;</hi> the end of the <hi>Law</hi> for Righteousness. As I have often expressed. Now whether you put it upon the account that <hi>Tythes</hi> were paid in the Old Law, or whether you put it as <hi>implicit</hi> in <hi>contracts</hi> of <hi>Lands,</hi> or <hi>Rents;</hi> without the consideration of which it is said that both Lands, and Rents will have an <hi>encrease</hi> of a <hi>Tenth;</hi> and so in <hi>Lands,</hi> and <hi>Rents,</hi> we buy, or take but <hi>Nine</hi> parts; and so that <hi>Tythes</hi> are only things passable through us as <hi>Conduit</hi> Pipes, and therefore not detainable by us, it signifies not at all in the point. For we (as I have said) refuse them not on that account; for if there was only that in it, we should submit unto them as unto all other civil <hi>Contracts,</hi> and should be so far from detaining of them, that we should be an Example to others, as we are in things of the <hi>like</hi> case; being for (and our Principle is so) the Propogation of eommon Justice among Men, or common Justice being our Principle. But here lies the Matter, It is paid as a <hi>Right</hi> to the <hi>Priesthood;</hi> and the <hi>Priesthood</hi> demands it as a <hi>Right;</hi> and the <hi>Law</hi> invests the <hi>Priesthood</hi> in <hi>this</hi> Right; and the <hi>Priesthood</hi> was the <hi>Original</hi> of it; and the <hi>Priesthood</hi> hath it; or that which was first in the <hi>Priesthood.</hi> Therefore that <hi>Priesthood</hi> in which of <hi>Old Tythes</hi> were invested, and for whose maintenance it was, who had <hi>no</hi> other Inheritance then this; and the Sacrifices in the time of the Law, being abrogated by the coming of <hi>Christ</hi> in the flesh; We who witness him come, and dead, and risen again, and ascended, cannot make this void, by owning of; and submitting to the maintenance of a <hi>Priesthood;</hi> or that which had its Original from <hi>Priesthood,</hi> and took its ground from that, seeing thereby we should deny <hi>Christ</hi> Jesus to be come in the flesh, and so be the
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:100370:31"/> Antichrist that <hi>John</hi> speaks of in his Epistles, Who is a lyer (saith he) but he that denies that <hi>Jesus</hi> is the Christ. And every Spirit that confesseth not that Jesus is come in the flesh is not of God; and this is that spirit of Antichrist whe<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>eof you have heard th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="2 letters">

            <p>Now, if all things be not at an end that the coming of Chri<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap> puts to an end; Christ is not come in the flesh, for if he were c<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

               </gap> puts an end to all that body of the <hi>Levitical,</hi> or <hi>Ceremonial</hi> Law; which hath an end in Christ. Therefore you affirming, or the af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firming, or those that affirme that Tythes are due; which was on<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

            <p>Now the Transmutation of things from one Vessel to another, from one Cover to another; from the <hi>Jus Divinum,</hi> or the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Right, when that will not hold to the <hi>Jus Humanum,</hi> or the Civil Right, when that is supposed to be of force, signifies little, but the ground is the matter, and the Original, and end, let the Transmutation be what it will. And so we deny the payment of <hi>Tythes,</hi> not because men seem to have a <hi>Civil</hi> property therein; For, for <hi>property</hi> we are, and to uphold <hi>property</hi> where it may shal with Truth, and against such we are who would overthrow it; but the ground of this pretended <hi>civil</hi> Property being from that which denies Christ to be come in the flesh, and which seeks to overthrow his coming, which is <hi>Antichrist,</hi> and a lyar; We i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> whom he is come, and who witness him to be come; cannot but deny it, cannot but oppose it, cannot but witness against it; and <hi>Cbrist</hi> who is our life, who is come, and we so witness him; testi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fies in us against it; and we cannot submit to it unless we will shy
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:100370:31"/> him again, and crucifie to our selves afresh the Lord of Glory. Therefore have we and are offred up, our Goods to the spoylers, and our Estates to the Robbers; and our Bodies to the Prisons, and our lives to the Death, and many of us have been offred up in it who have laid down the Body in Prisons for Tythes, and passed thorough irrecountable suffrings.</p>
            <p>Now, if so be the Charge had produced any thing of weight that Tythes in the Ground are <hi>Jure divino;</hi> or according to the Scriptures, or warranted there, (seeing the Scriptures that men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions them signifies as to what, and the ground upon which they were required, and the end of them) It had been somewhat to the purpose, and worthy of an Answer. But when it waves the <hi>Jus divinum,</hi> or <hi>spiritual,</hi> or <hi>Religious</hi> Authority, and comes only on a <hi>Civil;</hi> As in Point of <hi>Contracts;</hi> and the former <hi>Sale</hi> of <hi>Lands,</hi> and <hi>Letting</hi> of <hi>Leases,</hi> or <hi>Donations;</hi> this alters not the Case; nor is <hi>adrem;</hi> to the thing. For, that which is wrong in its ground, by continuance; or the seeming change of it by Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er; cannot be made right.</p>
            <p>For, Suppose a Man should be dispossessed wrongfully, or by force of his free-hold; and a change of <hi>Power comes;</hi> and declares the Right, or Title in the behalf of the Forcer, and calls the Free-hold after another name; and alters it into another manner of Conveyance; I hope no Man will conclude that this <hi>Continua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ta Injuria,</hi> or continued injury, is made <hi>Jus,</hi> or Right, by such a Declaration, or Transposition in the Conveyances of the same; or will hold that the Title is made good; or that the ground by which it is held by such a Declaration; or Conveyance is Right. And the reason lies here, because the Force was wrong; and the right Interest, or Title lies in another, and the <hi>forcible</hi> Tenure, or Transmutation, though it seemes to make it so, because by Power it was so held, whilst the Power so held it, makes it not right in the Foundation; but rather the long continuance of it o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwise; and the change of the Name, or Land-mark, calls loud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in Justice for it to be restored to him, to him whose at first it was; or to that Right, Title, or Interest, then to hold it other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise any longer on the contrary; especially if Process of time hath cut it off wholly by making void the end, or fulfilling it, for which that Tenure was held. If the end for, or by which he that
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:100370:32"/> held it Rightly comes to be fulfilled; and so the Tenure as to him doth cease; Certainly i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> common Right, or Justice, or according to it, he that hath the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>enure wrong, cannot hold it. I have gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven this <hi>Demonstration,</hi> that so by Comparing things with things; or expressing things that are more <hi>hid,</hi> by things that are more <hi>visible;</hi> the thing that I have to doe in, or doe assert, may be the more plainly understood.</p>
            <p>We know what <hi>Tithes</hi> are in the ground, as the Scriptures hold them forth, whose they were, and who ordained them, and for what end; and how the end is accomplished. They were commanded of God for a <hi>changeable</hi> Priesthood; which had a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> end in the <hi>unchangeable,</hi> which that <hi>changeable</hi> figured fo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>th; and was to continue but till then. The <hi>changeable</hi> Priesthood having an end by the coming of that which was the end thereof; ceased, and consequently all that appertained thereunto And no more Reason, or Ground is there to plead for <hi>Tithes</hi> on that Account, <hi>viz.</hi> on a <hi>Divine Right,</hi> then to plead for <hi>Aaron</hi>'s <hi>Bells,</hi> and <hi>Ephod;</hi> for that was part of, or appertained to the <hi>Priestbood</hi> that <hi>changed,</hi> as well as the other; and if one thing that so appertained to <hi>the</hi> Priesthood may be pleaded for; or is of Continuance; when the thing it self for which sake it had a being, hath an end; why may not all? But if it cannot be so in true Reason, or understanding; unless one will plead that the <hi>shaddow</hi> remains, when that is not which gave being to the <hi>shaddow;</hi> that is to say, is removed; how then can <hi>Tithes</hi> be due? I speak this in Allusion to; or as that which stands in the way of the <hi>Sun,</hi> as the <hi>Sun</hi> arises, or declines gives the <hi>shaddow;</hi> being removed; the <hi>shaddow</hi> of that is not; not in this place of <hi>Christ</hi> the substance, which did put an end to the <hi>Priesthood;</hi> which was the <hi>shaddow,</hi> or <hi>Image</hi> of him that was to come; which, he coming, put an end unto; and to all that which concern'd it.</p>
            <p>And so I have ended my Answer to this Particular. And I hope no sober Man upon due Consideration of what hath been said with the witness of God in him, and the Scriptures of Truth will soon, if at all conclude us because of this <hi>Suspect of Inju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring Common Justice between Party, and Party, or unfit for the Socie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of Men, and Publique Conversation.</hi> As the Conclusion of this Charge paints us forth to be.</p>

            <p> Having thus explained the preceeding words (as you put them) and phrases to (I hope) the common understanding of the World, I am sure to the Witness of God in Men, as they heed there what I have said, and weigh it; and having delivered our sence and judgment clearly, and plainly (so far as the nature of spiritual things will admit; which cannot be so understood as they are; but in the Principle of God to which in every one I have endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voured to speak) as to your foregoing Particulars wherewith you signify us to stand charged; I shall proceed in the next place (as you place it) in order to your entreaty, to satisfy your ensuing Cases, or Doubts, which (you say) have been raised upon those Opinions, which (as you express) we are supposed to hold, though the ground upon which those Opinions which we are sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed to hold being removed, or rather the mistake of our Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions, the Cases, or Doubts thereupon doe, of themselves cease. That so I may (as hitherto) ingeniously deale with you, and let you see that I am as willing, in what I may, to give you satisfa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction; as you are to desire it at our hands, if so be you will re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive it. I shall therefore proceed.</p>
            <p>Supposing (saith your Paper) that every Mans particular <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science,</hi> or the <hi>Seed,</hi> or <hi>Light which is within every Man;</hi> or the <hi>Natural Reason</hi> of every Man; and that which every particular Person calls his Reason, or the Light within him, be the Rule and Guide by which every particular Person is obliged to walk. I pray you tell us your judgments in these following dfficulties.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Ans.</hi> Before I proceed to your particulars, I must first rectify your mistake in your Suppositions, or the ground of them; which is—Supposing that every Mans particular Conscience, &amp;c. as a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>foresaid. Now we hold forth no such thing, as that <hi>Conscience,</hi> and the <hi>Seed,</hi> and the <hi>Light,</hi> and <hi>Natural</hi> Reason, or that which every particular Person calls his <hi>Reason,</hi> or the <hi>Light within him,</hi> is the same; Or that that which <hi>every</hi> Man calls <hi>so,</hi> is that by which <hi>e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very</hi> Man is <hi>obliged</hi> to walk. I have shewed the difference in the Answers to those particulars in the Preceeding Questions; where I have distinguished them; and shewed how that <hi>Conscience</hi> is nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <hi>Reason,</hi> nor the <hi>Light,</hi> nor the <hi>Seed,</hi> in that sence which we understand them; and that, that which a Man may take for the <hi>Light;</hi> may not be the <hi>Light,</hi> but what the <hi>Light</hi> is; and who it
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:100370:33"/> is that is the <hi>Light,</hi> I have spoken; and how it may be known; and wherefore it is so called; to the end, that Men may both have a certain knowledge of that which may lead them the right way to Salvation; and Guide, and Rule them; and how other false Guides, or mistaken, may be seen, and understood. And herein I have been particular, because these things are weighty, and of great concerment, and therefore I have not been wanting to speak freely, and fully to them; because the World hath been, and is in great mistakes about us in these things; Putting things together, jumbling, and confounding them; which have a distinct and proper understanding; because they know not these things, nor doe see, or know, or believe in that which might give them to understand; as aforesaid. And therefore it is that there is such a misunderstanding of us, and our Principles in the World; because Men are so ignorant in the Principles of Truth, and knowing n<gap reason="illegible" resp="#murp" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>t the Principle; and not weighing things there, they come to this Confusion; and think that we, and our Principles bear it, whe<gap reason="illegible" resp="#murp" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> it is in themselves. And as the Axiome holds true in other things; so it doth in this <hi>(sc) Scientia non habet Inimicum, nisi Ignorante<gap reason="illegible" resp="#murp" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>, (i. e)</hi> Knowledge hath not an Enemy, but the Ignorant; Truth, or the Knowledge of Truth; or those who know it, and both understand, and are led by the Principle thereof, hath no greater an Enemy then, or hath not an Enemy, but that which knowes it not; and therefore it is that there hath been such adoe in the World about us, and our Prnciples, since it came in these latter dayes to be made manifest, and that such persecution hath been, and is offred to us. All which we submit to the Lord, and leave things to his time, and wisdom to work over as he sees good; knowing, and being assured that it is his Truth, and that great is the Truth; and it will prevaile. In the mean time we are quiet; and do give our Backs to the smiters, and our Cheeks to the nip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pers, and the pullers of the Hair; and do not resist evil; knowing that the Lord will bring forth our Righteousness as the Light, a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#murp" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>d our upright Dealing as the Noon-day; and through all the Clouds that ignorant men, and malicious, and the enemy in all, hath drawn, and raised, he in his time, will make it manifest, and us i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#murp" extent="1 letter">

               </gap> it. And we feel his good Presence with us, which supports, a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#murp" extent="2 letters">

               </gap> upholds us; and as our Testimony is publique because of the
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:100370:33"/> Name of the Lord which we bear; and the feeling, and assurance that it is his Testimony; so he carries us through all the severities, and unhansome usages which we meet with from our Neighbours, and Countrymen; and is more to us in our peace, refreshing, and satisfaction, then the enjoyment of our liberty, and peace, and quietness would otherwise (perhapes) have afforded us; which we attribute only to the Goodness of the Lord; and his faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulnese, who leaves us not; but as we suffer for him, so he is with us in our sufferings; not to the cruelty of those who pretend to, and should be our friends, and Neigbours, but are otherwise; Who, what in them lies, puts us to all these things; which make us sufferings in the flesh; of which we are as sensible as other men, being in the same nature, and so they are pleasant to us, no more then to other men; if so be thereby they might put us to force our Consciences. But we hope, and are perswaded in the Lord Jesus; that he will as he hath kept us otherwise; and if for the Testimony of him he shall think fit yet to suffer more miseries to come upon us; more cruelties, yea Death, we are content, and do submit it unto him. In the mean time you shall see us (as here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tofore) constant through all to that which we pretend, which is the best Judication, next to the witness of God; that we can give to the truth of them, and that we are of God. And, as for our enemies, we pray, <hi>Father forgive them.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I say, the Suppositions of yours aforesaid have no ground as in us, as I have declared, and shewed particularly wherein, and therefore this mistake is to be rectified; for which purpose, I have now wrote. Nevertheless the things hanging in suspence with you is to the difficulties that (you say) arise to you, through such your mistaken apprehensions, and the Worlds; I shall endeavour to strike them aside also; and to give you satisfaction.</p>
            <p>First, you say, Suppose a particular person should perswade himself, or believe that his Conscience, or the Light within him that the Jewels of the Crown belong unto him, and some others whom he esteems Saints; and that God who hath title to the whole Earth; and the fulness thereof hath given to him, and those others, a title to those Jewels; whereupon this person com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth, and finding an opportunity seizeth on some of them; and being convicted he justifies himself with these, or the like words,
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:100370:34"/> Thus saith the Lord, I have given these Jewels to such, and such, (amongst whom he nameth himself,) meddle not with my People, because of their Conscience to me, which Conscience testifies to them their title to these Jewels; Therefore it is my will that they shall enjoy, and dispose of these Jewels, wheresoever they shall find them, We ask now may not the King punish thi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> person notwithstanding this plea? If the Kings Conscience tells him that he ought to punish this person, may not the King fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low the Guidance of his own Conscience? If you say, he may not; We pray you tell us the reason why he may not. If you say, he may; Then we desire you to inform us, by what rule must the King judge?

            <p>Suppose (say you) that the Magistrate should have a Perswasion from his Conscience, or the Light within him, that it is his duty, and he is obliged before God either to see that you doe those things which the Light within him perswades him to be your du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty to God, or Man; or else to banish you from among his People that they be not infected with those Doctrines of yours; which the Light within him perswades him to be damnable Errors, and tending to Treason, Rebellion, and Seditions; may not, nay ought not the Magistrate in such Cases to obey, and follow the Light that is within him? If you say he may not, then tell us why he may not. And why it belongs only unto you to judge? And what there is that must take away the Magistrates Liberty from him, and yet preserve you a Liberty to follow what you call the Light within you.</p>

            <p>What the Magistrates duty is, and how he standeth obliged be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore God as to these things, I have in Part answered. He is chiefly (as are all men) obliged to know, and believe in the measure of God in him; that of God in him, by whom Kings Reign (as I have said) and Princes Decree Justice; that he may know the will of God in such weighty things as appertain to his Charge; and to doe them. <hi>David</hi> the Son of <hi>Jesse</hi> said, and the Man who was raised upon high, the Anointed of the God of <hi>Jacob,</hi> and the

Therefore it concernes him e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>specially to know the measure of the Son of God in him, and to be guided by it; that so he may be Just, ruleing in the fear of the Lord: That so he may be to his People, to the People of the Lord, as the Light of the Morning, &amp;c. as aforesaid. So he will not need these Informations; or what you seem to Query, or to be satisfied in relation unto him. And this will shew him what be is to doe; and what he is not to doe; and that our Doctrines <gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="2 letters">

So that, it is not every Perswasion, every thing that dictates to him in his Conscience, that he is bound to obey, or follow; or that perswades him to be his duty to God, and Man; that is the true <hi>Light,</hi> or that which he is bound to follow, and obey, and is obliged thereunto; but what Christ the <hi>true</hi> Light saith that Lighteth every Man (and then it is <hi>within</hi> him) that cometh into
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:100370:36"/> the World. This will not lead him against Christ, but for him; not against his Scepter, Soveraignty, and Dominion, but bowing to him; not against his People who Worship him in Spirit, and in Truth, but in their behalfe; not making Lawes to banish them; but being a Protection unto them. So he will see his Duty to God and them; as he is guided by that of God which is in them, and him; and here will be an Agreement, and Harmony between them; not a Discrepancie, and Division; and here the Spirit of Supplication, to God he will find poured out for them; to the benefit of him, not the contrary. And if such a Day as this shall be as the Prophet Prophesied, who said unto his People, his Seed, his <hi>Israel</hi> in the day wherein he should cause to Inherit the Desolate Heritages, to <hi>Sion</hi> in whom his Soul delighteth—And Kings (saith he) shall be thy Nursing-Fathers, and their Queenes their Nursing-Mothers; they shall bow down to Thee with their f<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

And the Magistrate finding this is perswaded by the <hi>Light within him</hi> that it is his du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty to see Right done, and Justice done.

               </gap>e they had their Institution; or you do nothing. All these Trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferings,
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:100370:37"/> and new Nameings, and Mintings will not serve the turn. For, that which is not right in the ground can never be made right by chopping, and changing. And how comes it that you plead not the Divine Right, or that they are due to the Priesthood now, as they were of old to the Priesthood then? Is it because you judge it too gross; or hardly to be made out? Or have you ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther thing in your Budget? lies there somewhat else in the Pad? and so you only fight with us <hi>Jure humano</hi> by Man's Law, and <hi>civil</hi> contract; thinking that we cannot Answer you there; or go beyond you. No, no, you are mistaken; Truth is a Deep Mystery, and goes beyond you, and sees your bottom, and was before you; and him, who led out of it, and will be after you; We shall see an end of these things; though you may struggle a while, and put us to great and sore sufferings; as we have already under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gone much. And these things must, and will be manifest to all, as well as to us, and then all your Juglings, and craft will cease; and you must know your Judge; <hi>viz.</hi> That which you deride; and scorn, and make a mock of, and laugh at, as the <hi>Light within,</hi> and reproach it there; Christ Jesus the King of Kings, and Lord of Lords; the Lamb that stands on Mount Zion, who shall over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come, and lead Captivity captive in this Particular. And though you may have power to give life to the Image of the Beast, that the Image of the Beast shall both speak, and cause that as many as will not worship the Image of the Beast (for I see you who you are, or the spirit that works in you, the Lord hath shewn it me,) shall be killed, <hi>Rev.</hi> 13. 15. Yet into the Pit you, or the spirit that is now rising up in you (for as I have said, I do know you) must go; when your work is accomplished; and you have deceived the Nations, and wrought your Miracles; and performed the thing that yee shall be suffered to do; and then to judgment you must come, if you do not repent. And so I have finished this Parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular.</p>
            <p>And yet here is a Sur-charge in the end of all, <hi>viz.</hi> It is also charged upon you that many of the most knowing <hi>Quakers</hi> deny the Resurrection of Men's Bodies. Is this true, or not? and if false, then shew us how, or by what means by an inward Light without Scriptures; you come to know that the Bodies shall
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:100370:38"/> rise again. And if yee acknowledge Scripture help in this, why not in other things also. As the Beliefe in a Trinity, Sacraments, a Church, and her Government. These things I write not that I would have you persecuted (as God is my witness) but to have you give Reasons for your Opinions, and Practices.</p>
            <p>To this I answer, the <hi>Resurrrection</hi> of <hi>Mens</hi> Bodies, or of the <note place="margin">Concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Resurrec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Body.</note>
               <hi>Body,</hi> we doe not, nor never did deny. The Charge upon us in this particular is not true. We know the Dead shall be raised In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>corruptible; and we shall be changed, at the last Trump in a mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; in the Twinckling of an Eye; for the Trumpet shall sound. But this is a mistery. For this Corruptible must put on Incor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption; and this Mortall must put on Immortality, then shall be brought to pass the saying that is written, Death is swallowed up in Victory. O Death! where is thy Sting? O Grave! where is thy Victory? But every Man in his Order; Christ the first fruit<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> afterwards they that are Christs at his Coming. For as in <hi>Adam</hi> all dye, even so in Christ shall all be made alive. For, if there be no Resurrection of the Dead, then is not Christ risen, and i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> Christ be not risen, then is our Preaching Vain, and your Faith is also vain (saith the Apostle) yea, and we are found false Witnesses of God; because we have testified of God that he raised up Christ; whom he raised not up, if so be that the Dead rise not. For, if the Dead rise not then is not Christ raised, and if Christ be not raised your Faith is vain (saith He) you are yet in your Sinnes. Then they also who are fallen asleep in Christ are Perished, 1 <hi>Corinthi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans</hi> 15. 13. to the 24. 51. to the 56. And if in this life only we have hope, we are of all men most miserable.</p>
            <p>And so I have ended this Particular.</p>
            <pb n="75" facs="tcp:100370:38"/>
            <p> And now whether it be as thou hast said <hi>(sc)</hi> That these things thou writest, not that thou wouldst have us persecuted (as thou saist <hi>as God is thy witness)</hi> but to have us give Reasons for our O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinions, and Practises; Time will manifest.</p>
